There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function aplusb, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.

## Clarification

Are a and b both 32-bit integers?
* Yes.

Can I use bit operation?
* Sure you can.

## Example

Given a=1 and b=2 return 3.

## Challenge

Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not do it like that?(You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.)
